This project demonstrates the importance of password complexity in improving account security. Strong passwords that include a mix of characters and sufficient length are significantly harder to crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
The goal of this project is to encourage best practices for creating secure passwords.

Features

Checks password length

Verifies use of:

Uppercase letters

Lowercase letters

Numbers

Special characters

Provides feedback on password strength

Helps users understand why strong passwords matter

Why Password Complexity Matters

Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches. By enforcing complexity rules, this project helps:

Reduce the risk of unauthorized access

Protect sensitive user data

Promote better cybersecurity habits

How It Works

User inputs a password

The program evaluates it against predefined security rules

A strength rating or feedback is returned

Users can improve their password based on the results


Navigate to the project directory

Run the program following the instructions in the source file

📈 Future Improvements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI)

Include password breach detection

Support multiple languages

Add password strength scoring
